                <p><b>Sock it to 'em</b> is a real time multiplayer game where the aim is
                to duel it out with an opponent - whoever has the most kills within the
                time limit wins!</p>

                <div class='page-header'>
                    <h2>Getting started</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Simply head over to the <a href="/">home page</a> and login. If you
                don't already have an account, you can register (for free) and begin playing
                immediately. Once you're authenticated, you'll find yourself in the lobby.</p>

                <div class='page-header'>
                    <h2>The lobby</h2>
                </div>

                <h3 id='challenging-an-opponent'>Challenging an opponent</h3>

                <p>When you're in the lobby you'll see a list of all the other players
                currently waiting to play, as well as a list of games currently in progress.
                At this point, simply click on a user's name to challenge them to a duel -
                before issuing the challenge you'll be given the opportunity to review
                their <a href="#rankings">ranking</a> to see what's at stake.</p>

                <h3 id='receiving-a-challenge'>Receiving a challenge</h3>

                <p>Hang around long enough and you'll probably receive a challenge - when you
                do you won't be able to do anything until you've either accepted it or
                declined it (boo, hiss). You'll be given information about your challenger's
                <a href="#rankings">ranking</a> before you make your decision.</p>

                <h3 id='chatting'>Lobby chat</h3>

                <p>If you don't fancy getting involved, you can while away the time chatting
                to your fellow lobby dwellers. Even if nobody else is present, you'll always
                have <b>socketbot</b> for company who'll report on any game related news.</p>

                <p>Each game consists of a 2D, side-on view of both players and a barren wasteland between them. If you initiated
                the game (e.g. you're the challenger), you'll be on the left hand side. If you accepted a challenge, you'll be
                on the right. Using the following <a href="#controls">controls</a> you must aim and fire your weapon in an attempt to kill your
                opponent as many times as possible.</p>

                <p>In game control is handled exclusively by keyboard input. Put that

                <h3 id='rules'>Rules</h3>

                <p>Once a game has started, the rules are pretty simple &mdash; kill your opponent as many times as possible
                before the time runs out! Each time you die, you will respawn on a different platform to the last, though
                you will never change sides. Whoever has the most kills when the timer reaches zero is declared the winner.</p>

                <h3 id='sudden-death'>Sudden death</h3>

                <p>Should the scores be level when time runs out, sudden death mode will be declared. At this stage, the next person
                to kill their opponent wins the game.</p>

                <h3 id='rankings'>Rankings</h3>

                <p>Game rankings are gained by defeating your opponents. What you stand to gain &mdash; or lose &mdash;
                depends on how your rank compares with your opponent. The following table illustrates how your ranking
                will change if you win or lose a game:</p>
